We built a website that involves AI-powered inventory tracker that updates pantry stock in real-time for students and suggests needed items to donors while also offering recipe ideas for students.

Unique Differentiators:

      1. Real-time inventory tracking for informed donations.
      2. Creative recipe generator based on available ingredients.
      3.Machine learning models track expiration dates and prioritize 
        the  distribution of perishables, minimizing waste and ensuring 
        students receive fresh    food.
      4. Automated Alerts notify students of new stock arrivals.
      Goal:  To ensure that BMCC students not only have access to food     
      but also receive timely updates on perishables and ideas for using
       available ingredients.
